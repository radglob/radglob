### Hi there 👋

I'm a full-stack developer doing what I can to help the world write better software. Happily working at [Test Double](https://testdouble.com).

### ⌨️ Work work
For money, I write a mix of JavaScript, Ruby, and Elixir. On my own time, I pretty much just write Elixir and some Rust.

### Say hi or whatever 📫 
You can reach me by email (hello[at]radglob.com), or on Twitter ([@radglob](https://twitter.com/radglob) for now...) and also on Mastodon ([@radglob@ioc.exchange](https://ioc.exchange/web/@radglob)).

Pronouns are he/him or they/them.
